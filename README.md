# menu8g2
A lightweight menuing library using the u8g2 graphics library.

# Dependencies:
The following components need to be in the build path:
https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2

By default, you should clone these components into $(IDF_PATH/../third-party-components)

# Todo:
* Move button stuff in test/ to its own "inputs" component
* Make the button code a little bit more general
* More Unit tests
* Clean up code a little further
* Compartmentalize away button response code from menuing?
